# Elastic

**This is a development branch that is actively being worked on. DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION! If you want to use stable versions of Elastic, please use Go modules for the 7.x release (or later) or a dependency manager like [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep) for earlier releases.**

Elastic is an [Elasticsearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/) client for the
[Go](http://www.golang.org/) programming language.

## Releases

**The release branches (e.g. [`release-branch.v7`](https://github.com/olivere/elastic/tree/release-branch.v7))
are actively being worked on and can break at any time.
If you want to use stable versions of Elastic, please use Go modules.**

**Example:**

You have installed Elasticsearch 7.0.0 and want to use Elastic.
As listed above, you should use Elastic 7.0 (code is in `release-branch.v7`).

To use the required version of Elastic in your application, you
should use [Go modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules)
to manage dependencies. Make sure to use a version such as `7.0.0` or later.

To use Elastic, import:

```go
import "github.com/olivere/elastic/v7"
```

### Elastic 7.0

Elastic 7.0 targets Elasticsearch 7.x which [was released on April 10th 2019](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.0/release-notes-7.0.0.html).

As always with major version, there are a lot of [breaking changes](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.0/release-notes-7.0.0.html#breaking-7.0.0).
We will use this as an opportunity to [clean up and refactor Elastic](https://github.com/olivere/elastic/blob/release-branch.v7/CHANGELOG-7.0.md),
as we already did in earlier (major) releases.

### Elastic 6.0

Elastic 6.0 targets Elasticsearch 6.x which was [released on 14th November 2017](https://www.elastic.co/blog/elasticsearch-6-0-0-released).

Notice that there are a lot of [breaking changes in Elasticsearch 6.0](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.7/breaking-changes-6.0.html)
and we used this as an opportunity to [clean up and refactor Elastic](https://github.com/olivere/elastic/blob/release-branch.v6/CHANGELOG-6.0.md)
as we did in the transition from earlier versions of Elastic.

### Elastic 5.0

Elastic 5.0 targets Elasticsearch 5.0.0 and later. Elasticsearch 5.0.0 was
[released on 26th October 2016](https://www.elastic.co/blog/elasticsearch-5-0-0-released).

Notice that there are will be a lot of [breaking changes in Elasticsearch 5.0](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.0/breaking-changes-5.0.html)
and we used this as an opportunity to [clean up and refactor Elastic](https://github.com/olivere/elastic/blob/release-branch.v5/CHANGELOG-5.0.md)
as we did in the transition from Elastic 2.0 (for Elasticsearch 1.x) to Elastic 3.0 (for Elasticsearch 2.x).

Furthermore, the jump in version numbers will give us a chance to be in sync with the Elastic Stack.

### Elastic 3.0

Elastic 3.0 targets Elasticsearch 2.x and is published via [`gopkg.in/olivere/elastic.v3`](https://gopkg.in/olivere/elastic.v3).

Elastic 3.0 will only get critical bug fixes. You should update to a recent version.

### Elastic 2.0

Elastic 2.0 targets Elasticsearch 1.x and is published via [`gopkg.in/olivere/elastic.v2`](https://gopkg.in/olivere/elastic.v2).

Elastic 2.0 will only get critical bug fixes. You should update to a recent version.

### Elastic 1.0

Elastic 1.0 is deprecated. You should really update Elasticsearch and Elastic
to a recent version.

However, if you cannot update for some reason, don't worry. Version 1.0 is
still available. All you need to do is go-get it and change your import path
as described above.


## Status

We use Elastic in production since 2012. Elastic is stable but the API changes
now and then. We strive for API compatibility.
However, Elasticsearch sometimes introduces [breaking changes](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/breaking-changes.html)
and we sometimes have to adapt.

Having said that, there have been no big API changes that required you
to rewrite your application big time. More often than not it's renaming APIs
and adding/removing features so that Elastic is in sync with Elasticsearch.

Elastic has been used in production starting with Elasticsearch 0.90 up to recent 7.x
versions.
We recently switched to [GitHub Actions for testing](https://github.com/olivere/elastic/actions).
Before that, we used [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/olivere/elastic) successfully for years).

Elasticsearch has quite a few features. Most of them are implemented
by Elastic. I add features and APIs as required. It's straightforward
to implement missing pieces. I'm accepting pull requests :-)

Having said that, I hope you find the project useful.


## Getting Started

The first thing you do is to create a [Client](https://github.com/olivere/elastic/blob/master/client.go).
The client connects to Elasticsearch on `http://127.0.0.1:9200` by default.

You typically create one client for your app. Here's a complete example of
creating a client, creating an index, adding a document, executing a search etc.

An example is available [here](https://olivere.github.io/elastic/).

Here's a [link to a complete working example for v6](https://gist.github.com/olivere/e4a376b4783c0914e44ea4f745ce2ebf).

Here are a few tips on how to get used to Elastic:

1. Head over to the [Wiki](https://github.com/olivere/elastic/wiki) for detailed information and
   topics like e.g. [how to add a middleware](https://github.com/olivere/elastic/wiki/HttpTransport)
   or how to [connect to AWS](https://github.com/olivere/elastic/wiki/Using-with-AWS-Elasticsearch-Service).
2. If you are unsure how to implement something, read the tests (all `_test.go` files).
   They not only serve as a guard against changes, but also as a reference.
3. The [recipes](https://github.com/olivere/elastic/tree/release-branch.v6/recipes)
   contains small examples on how to implement something, e.g. bulk indexing, scrolling etc.

is described in the [Wiki](https://github.com/olivere/elastic/wiki).
